# neo4j and Cypher
Getting started with Neo4j check out [the wiki](https://github.com/charlesfinney/neo4j/wiki)  
  
Neo4j; Open source database software storing and quering data as nodes and relationships using the Cypher 
query language with index free adjacency.

## why Neo4j the connected enterprise 
Data driven decisions possible thousands of times faster by recognizing patterns and trends not visible in tradtional databases.
filling the need to make quick sense data relationships

## What is Cypher
### Graph pattern matching
a direct relationship
(Node)-[:RELATIONSHIP]->(Node)  
or   
(Node {key: value})-[:RELATIONSHIP]->(Node)  
or even traverse two relationships deep  
(Node {key: value})-[:RELATIONSHIP*..2]->(Node)
